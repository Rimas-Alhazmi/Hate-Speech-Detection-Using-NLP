There i no universally accepted definition of a mountain. Elevation, volume, relief, steepness, spacing and continuity have been used a criteria for defining a mountain.[4] In the Oxford English Dictionary a mountain i defined a "a natural elevation of the earth surface rising more or less abruptly from the surrounding level and attaining an altitude which, relatively to the adjacent elevation, i impressive or notable."[4] Whether a landform i called a mountain may depend on local usage. John Whittow' Dictionary of Physical Geography[5] state "Some authoriti regard eminence above 600 metre (1,969 ft) a mountains, those below being referred to a hills." In the United Kingdom and the Republic of Ireland, a mountain i usually defined a any summit at least 2,000 feet (610 m) high,[6] which accord with the official UK government' definition that a mountain, for the purpose of access, i a summit of 2,000 feet (610 m) or higher.[7] In addition, some definition also include a topographical prominence requirement, such a that the mountain rise 300 metre (984 ft) above the surrounding terrain.[1] At one time the US Board on Geographic Name defined a mountain a being 1,000 feet (305 m) or taller,[8] but ha abandoned the definition since the 1970s. Any similar landform lower than thi height wa considered a hill. However, today, the US Geological Survey conclude that these term do not have technical definition in the US.[9]
